# Hate Speech Detection

## Introduction
This project aims to detect hate speech in tweets using a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The model is trained on a labeled dataset that categorizes tweets into different classes based on the presence and type of hate speech. The implementation demonstrates the process of preparing the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.
